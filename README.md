## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
Hello, my name is Zang Wenchao, and I am a graduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Shandong Normal University (SDNU). My academic focus revolves around bioinformatics, where I apply computational techniques to analyze biological data, particularly genomic sequences.

I am currently working on various bioinformatics projects, including sequence alignment, data processing, and genome mapping using tools like Bowtie2 and SAMtools. With my passion for combining computer science with biological research, I aim to contribute to the growing field of computational biology.

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, programming, and expanding my knowledge of both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. I am always eager to collaborate with others and learn from diverse perspectives.

Thank you for your time and attention.
